# AyurMate

AyurMate is a modern, AI-powered Ayurvedic chatbot web application that blends traditional Ayurvedic wisdom with advanced technology. It offers multilingual support, user authentication, persistent chat history, and a visually appealing, professional user interface.

## 🌿 Project Overview

AyurMate is designed to make Ayurvedic knowledge accessible to everyone. Users can interact with the chatbot in English, Hindi, or Kannada, receive personalized remedies (with images), and manage their chat history securely. The application is built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and a neural network for intent detection.

## ✨ Features

- **Multilingual Support:** Communicate in English, Hindi, or Kannada. The chatbot translates queries and responses for seamless interaction.
- **Voice Interaction:** Speak to the bot and receive spoken responses (including Hindi and Kannada).
- **Visual Remedies:** Suggested remedies include images and names for better understanding.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login, registration, and logout with session management.
- **Persistent Chat History:** Each user's chat sessions are saved, can be reviewed, managed (delete/download sessions).
- **Modern UI:** Responsive, attractive design consistent across landing, login, and chat pages.
- **Session Management:** Sidebar for switching between chat sessions, with remedy images and names displayed per message.
